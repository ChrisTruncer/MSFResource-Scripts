This repo is set to contain a listing of metasploit resource scripts that I've created (or modified from existing scripts) for use on a pen test or CCDC event.

I plan to continuously document everything I use in here to share with anyone who would like to use it.  If you can make this better, by all means do so, and I'd be interested to see what you did.

Hope it helps.  I'm available at @christruncer
